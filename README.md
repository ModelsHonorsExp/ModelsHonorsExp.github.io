This is a golf game written in Javascript that demonstrates our research on air resistance and its influence on projectile motion. The project can be accessed [here](https://modelshonorsexp.github.io/).

The left view is a projection of the game from the side, and the right side is a top-down view. You can choose your club with the dropdown menu, and you can turn left and right using the arrow keys or the buttons. Tap or click once to set the vertical angle, then again to set the power.
